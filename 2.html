    <h1>Quotation and Citation Representation</h1>

    <p>In many writings, quotations and citations are used to emphasize ideas or refer to sources. Here are some examples of how to represent them:</p>

    <h2>Inline Quotation Example</h2>
    <p>Steve Jobs once said, <q>Stay hungry, stay foolish.</q></p>

    <h2>Block Quotation Example</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8982">
        "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."
        <footer>— Steve Jobs, <cite>Stanford Commencement Address, 2005</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Citation Example</h2>
    <p>According to recent research, "Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries" <cite>— Smith, 2022, AI in Modern Business</cite>.</p>

    <h2>Multiple Citations Example</h2>
    <p>Many studies have indicated that climate change impacts are severe <cite>— Johnson, 2019, Climate Effects</cite>, <cite>— Davies, 2020, Global Warming Insights</cite>.</p>
